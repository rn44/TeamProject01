#Commit
If a [*repository*](./Repository.md) in Git can be thought of as a book, commits are its pages. 
Commits in Git should be used everytime a change has been made, and ensure that they are made within the proper branch.
Ensuring that commits are in the proper and appropriate branch allows for better tracking and easier [*merging*](). 
Commits should also only be done when one is sure their self-contained change is complete.
