## Benefits of Git, Docker, and automated testing and integration
Automated testing and integration is the way of the future. 
No longer do companies, or individuals for that matter, need to focus on independent unit testing for their code.
Thanks to processes like Git, unit testing essentially happens with every commit and merge. 
While baseline tests and validations are run without any user configuration, specific unit tests can also be built.

Docker expands on the virtual machine phenomenon by virtualizing the whole OS (Operating System) to so that software can be packaged and containerized. 
This allows the VMs (virtual machines) to be slimmer and share resources better between the applications.
It also allows certain containers to be upgraded or downgraded without having to bring down or update other containers.
