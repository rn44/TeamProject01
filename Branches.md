#Branch
If a [*repository*](./Repository.md) in Git can be thought of as a book, branches are its chapters. 
Branches in Git should be used to create different collections of ["*commits*"]() to tell a similar story. 
One example of this would be to create a branch for every major feature in a software development project.
