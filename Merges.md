#Merge
The merge command is used to take changes from two separate [branches](./Branches.md) and combine them into one. 
This can be for combining several sub features and bug fixes into minor [branches](./Branches.md), or to combine whole branches into the master.
One would also merge remote changes into their local [repository](./Repository.md) to ensure they had the most up to date versions before starting anything new.
